Dark mode 2010scape UI. 

Here is how to make the Interface Styles plugin (i.e. High detail menu, High detail health bars) to work with this Resource pack.
1. First disable **both** the Interface Styles plugin and the Resource packs plugin. 
2. Then in the Inferfaces Styles plugin, make sure  `Gameframe` is set to `Default`.
3. Now, turn on the the Interface Styles plugin **first** and then the Resource packs plugin **second**. 

If it somehow bugs out and your interface looks messed up just repeat the above steps.

Here is a dark RS3 cursor to go with the pack. Save the following image as `cursor.png` and then put it in your `.runelite` folder. Then enable the `Custom Cursor` plugin and select `Custom Image` as your Cursor.

Note: Some icons cannot be lined up perfectly in Fixed mode and Classic Resizable mode. I reccomend playing with `Resizable - Modern layout` for the best experience. If something looks off or misaligned, odds are it can't be fixed. I tried my best to make the pack be at least on par with the Interface Styles plugin.
